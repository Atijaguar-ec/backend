# INATrace

Open-source blockchain-based track and trace system for an agricultural commodities (such as coffee) supply
chain run. It provides transparency and creation of trust through
digitalization of supply chains, connects every actor along the supply chain, assures quality and fair pricing.

Project is composed from 3 parts:

* [Java backend](https://github.com/INATrace/backend/tree/main) (Authentication, User, Product, Company APIs)
* [Coffee network](https://github.com/INATrace/coffee-network/tree/main) (StockOrder, Transaction, Order, SemiProduct APIs)
* [FE](https://github.com/INATrace/fe/tree/main)

Response is structured in following way:
It always contains attribute [`status`](https://github.com/INATrace/backend/blob/main/src/main/java/com/abelium/INATrace/api/ApiStatus.java).
If response is successful, then `status` is equal to 'OK' and appropriate response can be found under `data` attribute.
If response is unsuccessful (see above link for other statuses), then `errorMessage` attribute is returned.

Example of successful and unsuccessful response
```
{
"status": "OK",
  "data": {
    "id": 4,
    "email": "example@example.com",
    "name": "Example",
    "surname": "Example",
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "role": "ADMIN",
    "actions": [
      "VIEW_USER_PROFILE",
      "UPDATE_USER_PROFILE"
    ],
    "companyIds": [
	1
    ]
  }
}
```

```
{
  "status": "AUTH_ERROR",
  "errorMessage": "Invalid credentials"

```
